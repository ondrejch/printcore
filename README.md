# printcore
Printcore generates EPS image representing a reactor core with color coded per-assembly information such as power density.
The program can generaete sqaure, hexagonal, and triangular grids. It can also be used to print pin-by-pin information since 
the geometry of a fuel assembly is the same (hexagonal or square) like the core grid of fuel assemblies.

Compile by typing 'make' in the src directory.
